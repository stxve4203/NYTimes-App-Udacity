# NYTimes-App-Udacity

As the last Udacity project I decided to create a news app with the NYTimes API. You can choose every category it has to offer. You can read the top stories for the chosen category. 

If you liked an article and wanna read it again, you can save it to favorites and it will display in the 'Favorites' tab.
